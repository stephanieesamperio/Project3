# ETL - Workplace Mental Health Data

 **Mai Le, Okechukwu Odunze(OC) & Stephanie Samperio**



⦿ **Project Overview**

   In this project, we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform data. We created 3 seperate CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD. We also uploaded our CSV file data into a Postgres database.
   
 ⦿ **Dataset Summary: Mental​ Health​ at Workplace ​Survey (CSV)**
 
   This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.
 


⦿ **Research Questions**
   - Does family history of mental illnesses affect the likelihood of the individual to reach out for mental health assistance?
     
   -  If the worksplace offers mental health assitance are employees more likely to seek treatment?

   -  If the worker is anonymously protected are they more likely to seek out help from their workplace mental health assistance programs?
     
   -  For each year, what countries with over 500 employees would ask about mental and physical interviews?

   - Between those countries how many employers care about mental and physical illnesses?
