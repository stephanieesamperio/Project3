 **Mai Le, Okechukwu Odunze(OC) & Stephanie Samperio**



⦿ **Project Overview**

   In this project, we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform data. We created 3 seperate CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD. We also uploaded our CSV file data into a Postgres database.


⦿ **Research Questions**
   - Does family history of mental illnesses affect the likelihood of the individual to reach out for mental health assistance?
     
   -  If the workplace offers mental health assistance, are employess less likely to suffer from mental health?

   -  If the worker is anonymously protected are they more likely to seek out help from their workplace mental health assistance programs?
     
   -  For each year, what countries with over 500 employees would ask about mental and physical interviews?

   - Between those countries how many employers care about mental and physical illnesses?
